1. os and os.path libraries are used to navigate files in Python. 
2. os.getcwd() 
3. Hope this answers the question! For full code, with all of the checks and errors, see 676_lab4_practices.ipynb

import os
import os.path
import shutil

cur_dir = os.getcwd()

webfiles_dir = os.path.join(cur_dir, 'data', 'webfiles-samples')

contents = os.listdir(webfiles_dir)

for item in contents:
    if (os.path.isdir(os.path.join(webfiles_dir, item))):
        item_dir = os.path.join(webfiles_dir, item)
        print(os.listdir(item_dir))
    else:
        pass

4. Os.path() helps identify the different parts of the filepath, and to split up paths. This helps us operationalize opening many files with similar file paths and performing a function. 

5. Using open() and close() directly opens the file. You must do this to write to a file in Pything. Once a file is opened, it requires being closed, close(). However,  "with open()" allows us to write to a file (if it is there) without having to remember to use the close() function. With open() will automatically close the file once the look is finished. At the moment I prefer "with open()" because that's the way it was taught in class. Plus the added benefit of not needing to remember to use close().
